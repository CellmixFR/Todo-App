## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge was to build out a todo app and get it looking as close to the design (in the "design" folder) as possible.

Users should be able to : 

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode
(**Bonus**: Drag and drop to reorder items on the list: not done)
